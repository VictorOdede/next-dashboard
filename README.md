## Overview

This app uses Next JS and ChartJS library to retrieve data from a web server and present it to the user. The application adheres to the following principles:

- Retrieves the most recent data during each render to ensure that the user has access to the most up-to-date information.
- Fetches only the necessary data for display, minimizing network traffic and improving application performance.
- Executes resource-intensive tasks on the server side to reduce the load on the client device and improve overall performance.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
